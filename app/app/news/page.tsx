      <p>
        Worth of Words can now be played on mobile, and it now supports
        email-based login as well as passkeys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, <b>previously created passkeys will no longer work</b>.
        If you wish to keep using passkey login, you will need to create a new
        one. Sorry about that!
